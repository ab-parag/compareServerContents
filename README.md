# compareServerContents
This utility provides ready-to-run python codes which extracts data from different servers and compare them to check whether they are identical or not.
The utility can be useful mostly when DR tests are being plan in the organisation as the very pre-requisit of a DR test is - both PROD and DR must be in sync.
Most of the time due to multiple reasons, all the deployments doesn't go on PRDO and DR servers equally (don't blame the deployment team!! :p) and this is where the gaps starts occuring.

In order to identify these gaps the given code can be used just by changing few input parameters and achieve the results with literally no manual efforts.
